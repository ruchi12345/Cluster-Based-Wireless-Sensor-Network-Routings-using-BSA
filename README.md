# Cluster-Based-Wireless-Sensor-Network-Routings-using-BSO
Wireless sensor network is an emerging field for research in todayâ€™s world. Wireless sensor networks have vast potential for usage of sensor networks in different areas like military area, disaster management, sensing environment conditions such as temperature, humidity etc. In wireless sensor networks, as no. of sensor nodes are used for communication which mainly forms a sensing field and sink.  There are many issues in sensor network but energy consumption is a crucial issue. Therefore, there is a need to improve energy consumption of the network.  In the existing work, ACO has been used but consume more energy and degrade network performance. Therefore, to overcome this problem BSO will be implemented to improve energy consumption issues and evaluate its parameters.
